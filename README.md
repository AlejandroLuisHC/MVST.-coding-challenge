# GitHub RepoExplorer

The task was to display repositories and allow the users to filter through the repositories by name using a search bar. 

## Start üöÄ

Get a clone of the project in local. You need to have installed NodeJS in your computer to develop the proyect.

### Requirements üìã

_You need to install nodejs_

Go to [NodeJS web page](https://nodejs.org/es/) download and install the
program.

### Instalation üîß

_First clone the repository_

```
git clone https://github.com/AlejandroLuisHC/MVST.-coding-challenge
```

_Then run 'npm install' in the base folder_

```
npm install
```

_After this, open another terminal to run the server with 'npm run dev'_

```
npm run dev
```

## Future Implementations üöÄ
Here are some possible future implementations for this repository:

- Implementing a user login system to allow users to save their favorite repositories or track their activity on the platform.
- Adding more filters and sorting options to allow users to search for repositories based on different criteria like programming language, stars, forks, etc.
- Implementing a graphical representation of the data, such as charts or graphs, to provide users with a visual representation of the data.
- Adding more information to the repository page, such as code analysis, pull requests, issues, and other relevant data.
- Integrating the platform with other APIs, such as social media or job boards, to provide users with more information and opportunities related to the repository.
- Adding a recommendation system that suggests repositories to users based on their activity and preferences.
- Improving the search functionality by implementing autocomplete or suggestions based on the user's input.

## Possible Improvements üí°
Here are some possible improvements that can be tackled in future updates:

- Improving the performance of the platform by optimizing the code, caching data, and reducing the number of API requests as well as paginating the data retrieved.
- Making the platform more accessible by improving the user interface and ensuring that the platform is compatible with assistive technology.
- Improving the error handling by providing more informative error messages and guiding users on how to fix the errors.
- Adding tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the platform.
- Adding multilingual support to make the platform accessible to a wider audience.

## Feedback üì£
Completing this technical challenge was a great learning experience for me. It allowed me to practice my skills in **React**, **Redux**, and other popular libraries while also exposing me to new technologies like the **GitHub GraphQL API** and **TypeScript**.

One of the biggest challenges I faced during this project was getting a sound grasp on the **GitHub GraphQL API**. While I had worked with **REST APIs** before, **GraphQL** was a new concept for me, and it took some time to understand how to structure the queries. However, once I got the hang of it, I found the **GraphQL API** to be very powerful and flexible, and it allowed me to retrieve the data I needed in a very efficient way.

Another challenge I faced was using **TypeScript** instead of **JavaScript** for this project. While **TypeScript** is becoming more and more popular, it still has a bit of a learning curve, and I had to spend some time getting used to the syntax and the type system. However, once I started writing **TypeScript** code, I found it to be very helpful in catching errors early and providing more robust code and type checking.

Overall, I found this technical challenge to be very **useful and engaging**, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on it. I believe that this project helped me improve my skills as a developer, and I look forward to working on more projects like this in the future.
